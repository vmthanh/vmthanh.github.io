Hi! 

Welcome to my blog. I'm Thanh and I'm a greek in computer and software. 

But now, I'm pursuing the Master Degree about Computer Science in Korea. This work does not require me code a lot, but think much instead. Recently, I'm fucking stressed very much. So I decided to create this blog, where I could write it down to ease my mind :) Glad you come here. I hope that it will not waste your time :) 

To finish, let's doing one thing that developers like me often do when learning a new programming language or new thing:
	
 {% highlight python %}
 from __future__ import division, print_function
 print Hello World
 {% endhighlight %}
