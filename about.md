Nice to meet you!

My name is Vo-Minh Thanh. I'm a software engineer. My main working is about Android and web application. 

Currently, I'm a Master student at [Sejong University](http://sejong.ac.kr/) in South Korea. My interests are about Computer Vision, 3D Face Resconstruction and Deep Learning. 

In my spare time, I'm also a blogger loving to share my thoughts with everyone.

Interested in me, find more with [resume](../resume).

Thanks for reading!
