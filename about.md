Nice to meet you!

My name is Vo-Minh Thanh. 

I graduated in Information Technology Department, major in Computer Science at University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2012. After that, I got the Master Degree in Sejong University, South Korea in 2019. 

In the past, I was an **Android developer**. But after graduation, I joined [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/), a start up e-commerce company in Singapore with the **Data Scientist** position. My interests are about Computer Vision, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

In my spare time, I'm also a blogger loving to share my thoughts with everyone.

Interested in me, find more with [resume](../resume).

Thanks for reading!
