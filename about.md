Welcome to my site!

I'm Vo-Minh Thanh, from Vietnam. 

I graduated in Information Technology Department, major in Computer Science at University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2012. After that, I got the Master Degree in Sejong University, South Korea in 2019. 

I used to be **Android Developer**. But after master graduation, I joined [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/), an e-commerce company in Singapore with the **Data Scientist** position till now. My interests are about Computer Vision, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

In my spare time, I'm a remote researcher in some selected fields (computer vision, deep learning, big data).

Interested in me, find more with [resume](../resume).

Thanks for reading!
